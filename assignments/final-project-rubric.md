# Final Project Rubric

## Project Description
Students will design a civic‑engagement proposal that addresses a local or national democratic challenge. The proposal should include:
1. Problem identification and background research.
2. Analysis of relevant democratic principles.
3. Concrete action plan with feasible steps.
4. Evaluation metrics for success.

## Submission Requirements
- 2000‑2500 word written proposal.
- Visual aid (e.g., infographic, slide deck) summarizing the plan.
- 5‑minute recorded presentation.

## Grading Breakdown
- Written Proposal: 60%
- Visual Aid: 20%
- Recorded Presentation: 20%

## Detailed Rubric
### **Content & Research (30%)**
- **Exemplary (27‑30)**: Thorough research, nuanced understanding of democratic theory, compelling problem framing.
- **Proficient (24‑26)**: Solid research, clear connection to course concepts, adequate background.
- **Developing (18‑23)**: Limited research, weak theoretical grounding, superficial problem statement.
- **Beginning (0‑17)**: Inadequate research, no clear theoretical link, poorly defined problem.

### **Analysis & Argument (30%)**
- **Exemplary (27‑30)**: Sophisticated analysis, innovative application of principles, well‑reasoned argument.
- **Proficient (24‑26)**: Logical analysis, appropriate application of principles, coherent argument.
- **Developing (18‑23)**: Simplistic analysis, partial application of principles, inconsistent argument.
- **Beginning (0‑17)**: Little analysis, misapplication of principles, unclear argument.

### **Feasibility & Practicality (20%)**
- **Exemplary (18‑20)**: Action plan is realistic, detailed, and creatively addresses constraints.
- **Proficient (16‑17)**: Action plan is practical, includes key steps, acknowledges limitations.
- **Developing (12‑15)**: Action plan is vague, overlooks important obstacles, lacks detail.
- **Beginning (0‑11)**: Action plan is unrealistic, missing essential components.

### **Clarity & Presentation (20%)**
- **Exemplary (18‑20)**: Polished writing, effective visual design, engaging presentation.
- **Proficient (16‑17)**: Clear writing, adequate visual design, competent presentation.
- **Developing (12‑15)**: Writing is occasionally unclear, visual design is basic, presentation lacks polish.
- **Beginning (0‑11)**: Writing is confusing, visual design is poor, presentation is difficult to follow.
